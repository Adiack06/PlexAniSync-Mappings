# PlexAniSync-Mappings
This is a collection of [custom-mappings](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync#custom-anime-mapping "custom-mappings") for the [PlexAniSync](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync "PlexAniSync") plex addon.

Tested for maximum compatibility TVDB, TMDB and the new Plex Scanner.


- Plex Season and Anilist Entries are respective to each other.
- Plus (+) sign indicates that two Anilist entries have been mapped to a single Plex Season respectively.
- TVDB Specials cannot be matched with custom mappings due to [PlexAniSync not supporting Season 0/Specials](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync/issues/80#issuecomment-944931420).
- You may need to change titles on some mappings if it changes on TheTVDB or you tweak your Plex entry.
