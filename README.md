# Installation on unRAID
First you need to install the PlexAniSync Docker, if you have that already, you can skip this section.

This is easiest done with the [Community Applications](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/38582-plug-in-community-applications/) plugin. (Installation from dockerHub must be enabled).

Enter the Variables according to the [dockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rickdb/plexanisync/)

Configure the Path to be in your AppData folder named "PlexAniSync-Mappings" and create that folder.

**Installation of the Mappings**

You can automate the mappings with a simple script that can be run with the "User Scripts" plugin (also in the Community Applications)

Create a script with a name (preferrably PlexAniSync) and add this:
``` 
#!/bin/bash
rm -r /mnt/user/appdata/PlexAniSync/*
cd /mnt/user/appdata/PlexAniSync
git clone https://github.com/mizz141/PlexAniSync-Mappings.git
docker restart plexanisync
```
The Script will cd into the appdata folder you created, clone the repo, and restart the Docker Container. 

You can set the update interwall to whatever you like, best results are gained with a Daily inteval. It's recommended to test-run the script for any errors, most commonly a misnamed container or wrong filepath.
